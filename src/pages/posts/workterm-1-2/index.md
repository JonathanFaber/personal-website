Zeitspace is a fast growing company. When I was hired they had a total of nine employees, by the end of my work term they had a total of 15 employees including 3 Co-op students. They expect to hire many more employees this year.

Zeitspace is a company with a positive and friendly atmosphere. They have an open office layout with no cubicles that allows for easy communication with other team members.
