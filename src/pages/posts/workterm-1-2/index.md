### About Zeitspace

Zeitspace is a software product design and development consultancy. They were founded on Halloween 2016 and are currently located in uptown Waterloo. Zeitspace is different in that they do not sell their own software but rather their design and development expertise. Companies will pay Zeitspace for anything ranging from advice to product creation.

Zeitspace is a fast growing company. When I was hired they had a total of nine employees, by the end of my work term they had a total of 15 employees including 3 Co-op students. They expect to hire many more employees this year.

Zeitspace is a company with a positive and friendly atmosphere. They have an open office layout with no cubicles that allows for easy communication with other team members.

### Learning Goals

#### 1. Learn and use many new technologies
These technologies include programming languages, libraries and frameworks.
My plan was to do work which is totally new to me and not being afraid of trying out new things.
I got to learn many new technologies! The most important technologies I learned were, JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, JQuery, HTML, CSS. I also got some basic experience with other techs. 

#### 2. Contribute more in project meetings
I have a more reserved personality, and I wanted to work on sharing my ideas in a group setting. To do so I worked on sharing and explaining my opinion more often. I did with a specific focus on project meetings because that is where I had the most trouble. In our weekly meeting there was a portion called the retrospective. It is where everyone on the team reflects on the week and explains what they think the team should start doing, do more, keep doing, do less, and stop doing. The retrospective definitely provided a great platform for me to achieve my learning goals. This was definitely my most challenging learning goal. Although there is much room for progress, I definitely improved and my team saw it as well. I have learned that sharing my opinion can generate discussion and help not just myself, but others as well, with understanding the objectives of the team and the project.

#### 3. Do some pair programming
For a challenging problem I will find a partner and pair up. One partner, the driver, writes code and the other partner, the observer, reviews the code as it is written. Ideally there is a lot of communication between the driver and the observer. I plan on doing the roles of both the driver and the observer.
I did pair programming twice. The first time, I paired up with a senior developer, and I was the driver. It was a confusing task and they helped me see things in different ways, which helped me to better understand the problem. The second time, I was the observer and helped my team member solve a few problems. Overall pair programming is an effective way to speed up learning and task completion. I hope to use it much more in the future.


### Job Description

During my time at Zeitspace I had the opportunity to work on several distinct projects. All of the projects involved full stack development.

The first project I worked on was a mobile first web app for Shore Centre. Shore Centre is a great place to go in Waterloo for information regarding sexual health options, resources and education. Zeitspace had worked with them previously and had developed a web app that can help anyone get a referral to the abortion provider in southwestern Ontario that best meets their needs. I worked on it with my boss who is a designer, as well as two full time software developers. Our job was to improve upon the existing app in order to get it ready to work across all of Canada, rather than just southwestern Ontario. I worked on all portions of the app including what could be  viewed by a user looking for a referral, and the content management system.

The second project I worked on was for Fluxible.

### Conclusion

I am glad to have had the opportunity to work at Zeitspace. This was my first job relating to computer science and my Co-op at Zeitspace has convinced me that I chose the right career path.
